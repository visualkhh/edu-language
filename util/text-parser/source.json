  "Your favorite coffee? For something we feel so strongly about,",
  "we may not necessarily have a strong preference.",
  "When we first start off learning coffee,",
  "we tend to be overwhelmed by the large amount of coffee types,",
  "the different regions, until we finally get an understanding and slowly,",
  "we decide we have strong opinions about which would like. But then,",
  "after that, it can get to the point where you don’t actually have a preference.",
  "That different tastes are attractive in different ways.",
  "That there is a never-ending experimentation that happens with your taste buds to find a cup of coffee that you absolutely enjoy.",
  "But perhaps it’s because you have higher and higher standards the more you drink coffee and therefore can’t really develop a strong preference.",
  "Maybe it’s because everything starts to taste more mediocre and mundane.",
  "But as long as we’re looking for a better cup of coffee,",
  "a more delicious cup of coffee,",
  "I feel like will continuously be able to produce and drink that butter cup of coffee.,",
